        "thumbnail_url": "",
        "content": "\nTan Hiep Phat, a Vietnamese beverage maker, focuses on developing human resources, creating a sustainable and fast-growing business to reach the billion-dollar revenue goal.\t\nAt the end of the first quarter, Tan Hiep Phat maintained its production targets, with several business indicators improved over the same period last year. Deputy General Director of Tan Hiep Phat, Tran Uyen Phuong, says the company, with its growth momentum, is on track to reach the target of becoming one of the leading Vietnamese beverage enterprises in Asia. The group focuses on building internal resources, as the foundation for a regional empire.\n\"Everyone plays a certain part in the organization, just as every screw is crucial to the whole machine. A loosened screw can lead to machine breakdown. And likewise, a mistake can interrupt production. What made Tan Hiep Phat today is a group of people with a common goal, so we always focus on improving our human resource policy, operating system, and working environment, striving for employee self-development.\"\nEstablished in 1994, Tan Hiep Phat's journey has revolved around seven core values, including customer satisfaction, international standard, corporate social responsibility, mastery at work, 'nothing is impossible', 'today must be better than yesterday, and tomorrow isn't better than today' spirit, and integrity.\nPhuong highlighted that these values help promote employee capacity and make a difference at Tan Hiep Phat. Entering the company, each staff member will be trained along a development path from recruitment to retirement. Each developmental milestone has clear criteria on capabilities, achievements, job management skills... Even if you are not a Tran family member, you can still become a CEO if you meet the requirements.\nThe company's board of directors ensure staff enjoys conditions to develop themselves, strengthening each team for the growth of the entire organization. Realizing this commitment, Tan Hiep Phat offers a series of training courses on job expertise, soft skills, leadership skills with international experts.\n\"Tan Hiep Phat has adopted a leadership capability framework tailored for the development roadmap, along with a center for reviewing, training, and receiving employee feedback, consulted by a global leadership research firm. The consulting team was quite surprised that we got this far because even multinational corporations have only implemented this model at their headquarters for the past three years, to enhance the senior management team,\" she added.\nNew managerial employees will have a companion who supports them with internal networking, training, company culture and core values, to quickly integrate into the organization. According to the career development roadmap, this employee will be able to participate in appropriate training courses, and will be regularly rotated to broaden knowledge and perspectives. Senior leaders will have the opportunity to attend more specialized training courses.\nDaily tasks and new projects are the most effective and practical training classes for employees. Tran Thi Thu Ha, a staff member in the QC department, in charge of measuring materials, entered the company when she was a fresh graduate, clumsy and unable to distinguish ingredient code numbers, causing loss of raw materials. After four months of training, she was able to accurately weigh each gram, ensuring strict physicochemical standards, and neatly handled a material barrel of more than 200 kilograms.\nHa described each ingredient proudly: \"2E is very sweet. 3E is fickle, causing her boss go to the company many times in the middle of the night to fix problems. 4E is often confused with 3E when placed on a pallet.\" Ha always had colleagues to support her when she couldn't pick up ingredients from the manufacturers in time or faced other troubles.\n\"The company helps me gain more life and work experience that cannot be learned from books,\" Ha said.\nTon, an employee at the Hau Giang factory, said he is frequently trained and receives performance reviews through a public evaluation system to rank and record achievements. Those with good achievements will be recognized in front of the team, offered salary increases and assigned a rewarding position.\n\"No matter what department you work at, as long as you make an effort and deserve it, all contributions will be recognized and honored,\" he said.\nThe working process encourages innovation and improvement. All procedures are standardized so that employees have a clear understanding of each task and timeline, and propose initiatives with improvement tools to solve problems.\nAll opinions will be listened to through different channels like the intranet, where employees can contact their senior management.\nUyen once ran with a staff member in the factory ground. He confided that there was a serious matter but only told Phuong or Dr Thanh (CEO of Tan Hiep Phat) about it, which made Uyen laugh because he had no idea that the person who was running with him was the Vice President. Since then, Uyen Phuong has been interacting more with employees, hosting livestreams, and enhancing connection with employees to better understand them and the company's operation.\n\"Besides systematic discipline, in order to boost the development of each employee, Tan Hiep Phat has built the company as a big family, with each staff member considered family. Therefore, your success is my happiness,\" Phuong said.\nThis motto is further evidenced in the 125 days implemented \"three on the spot\" at Tan Hiep Phat during the pandemic, when everyone ate, slept, worked at the factory, and shared little things with each other. The leaders always tried to spread the positive vibes to each member, so that they could complete their tasks.\nLast year, despite facing numerous challenges due to Covid-19, the company did not cut salaries or bonuses. The company increased the welfare as a way of appreciating the contribution of employees during the pandemic.\n\"Staying competitive without affecting the lives of employees is challenging, but we are confident that we are getting better every day,\" Phuong said.",

        "content": "\nWind and solar power account for a third of capacity and generate 15 percent of output in Vietnam, but there is still a risk of shortages in summer.\t\nVietnam has wind power plants with a capacity of 3,900 MW, but most of the time their output is less than half of this, according to data from the National Load Dispatch Center.\nOn March 19, for instance, there was little or no wind and the output fell to 15 MW, or 0.37 percent of capacity.\nEVN deputy general director Vo Quang Lam said power generated from wind changes not just seasonally but daily, even hourly.\nHa Dang Son, director of the Center for Energy and Green Growth Research, said renewables were insignificant in the past with small-scale plants only.\nBut they are now a vital part of the power grid, and so it is a challenge for operators to overcome the uncertainty, and a forecasting tool to match demand and supply is imperative, he said.\nTrinh Quoc Vu, vice chief of staff of the Steering Committee for Energy Saving, cited the example of Ireland, which exports power to neighboring Britain, but struggles in winter, the peak season amid demand for heating, when there is no wind to generate power.\nHe also pointed to geographical and transmission limitations faced by renewables.\nWind and solar power plants are concentrated in Vietnam’s central and southern parts, where demand is lower than the north, while transmission infrastructure is inadequate.\nEVN estimated that the northern part may lack about 1,500-2,400 MW during the summer’s peak.\nCurrently, Vietnam only generates 40,000 MW of electricity as against a designed capacity of 76,600 MW.\nRenewable sources accounted for 30 percent of total installed capacity, or 20,700 megawatts, at the end of last year, according to national utility Vietnam Electricity.\nThey generated 13.2 billion kilowatt-hours in the first four months of this year, accounting for 15.4 percent of production.\nEnsuring supply\nTo ensure power supply during the peak season, EVN said it could buy 130 MW from Laos and 500 MW from China if needed. It is also planning to expand some hydropower plants and stock up on coal and gas for generators.\nLam said electricity production should increase by 8.3-12.4 percent this year to meet post-Covid recovery demand.\nIt needs to develop energy as a service market to stabilize the power grid and optimize supply, he added.\nExperts called for promoting energy-saving solutions to reduce the burden on the power grid.\nVietnam has yet to become an energy-efficient country, using up to 400 kilograms of oil for each US$1,000 to GDP. It is 30 percent higher than the rate for Thailand, 40 percent higher than Malaysia’s and four or five times higher than the U.S.’s.",

        "content": "\nAiming to become one of the top 10 banks in Southeast Asia, Vietnam's Techcombank is prioritizing sustainable growth over the long-term.\t\n\"Even in the very tough environment we are seeing, our employees have maintained a high quality and reliable service for our customers and this is helping us deliver stellar performance year after year,\" said Jens Lottner, CEO of Techcombank.\nLast year, the bank continued to reduce costs while focusing on building deposits in its current accounts and savings accounts (CASA), which Lottner described as a \"stable and cheap\" source of funding. Techcombank’s CASA ratio, which reflects the percentage of the bank’s total deposits that are CASA, jumped from 46.1 percent in 2020 to 50.5 percent last year, on its way to the bank’s target of 55 percent by 2025.\nTechcombank’s net interest margin (NIM), a measure of the difference between the interest received by the bank and the amount paid out to lenders, also increased 69 basis points to 5.6 percent during the year.\n\"Together, these improving metrics, along with our effective cost management, translated into an excellent profit before tax of approximately VND23.2 trillion ($1 billion) last year,\" Lottner elaborated.\nThe strength of Techcombank’s balance sheet coupled to its robust performance, enabled the bank \"to finance increased support for those customers facing difficulties due to Covid-19,\" he added.\nLottner, who spent most of his career in the financial services industry in Asia, believes that with a return on average assets of 3.7 percent, Techcombank is now one of the most efficiently operated banks across all of ASEAN.\nCustomers are the priority\nTechcombank’s success in recent years has been based on a customer centric strategy claimed Lottner. This places huge emphasis on understanding individual customers and providing them with personalized experiences and solutions to meet their needs.\nAt the heart of the bank’s strategy is the enhancement of its digital and data processing capabilities that are helping to paint a more holistic picture of customers and empowering customer engagement through digital channels.\nBreaking the stereotype of incumbents being slow to adapt, Lottner explained that Techcombank was striving to achieve a level of technology adoption where \"there's no big difference between us and any fintech business in terms of technology.\"\nTechcombank’s digital transformation was highlighted in April 2022 when it launched its new mobile banking app, enabling customers to access a full range of retail banking products and services on the go from their mobile phone.\n\"Intelligent insight is the differentiation that the new Techcombank app will bring, so that we can still underwrite you even if you're a new-to-bank customer,\" Lottner said.\nHe claimed that the Techcombank app will, in the long term, enable human-like interaction with customers, and that the bank planned to migrate 5 million customers to its upgraded app by the end of this year.\n\"Once we can build out that seamless experience over digital channels, just as if a customer was interacting in a branch, and we scale that up, it will be very hard for competitors to replicate,\" he explained.\nTechcombank’s commitment to technology and data runs throughout the organization, Lottner said, \"We aim to be a cloud-based company, and we are currently building a data lake in the cloud that will empower better and faster decision making and time-to-yes for customers.\"\nLottner revealed that Techcombank hired about 4,300 new employees in 2021 alone, roughly 700 of whom were recruited into technology, digital and data. In addition, new software platforms are being implemented across compliance, training, transaction banking, customer relationship management, underwriting, and other functions.\nDigital adoption appears to be the right strategy for banks in Vietnam and this is reflected in the feedback Techcombank receives from its customers. According to the bank, its brand consideration score was well above the industry average and its Net Promoter Scores (NPS), which reflects customer loyalty and satisfaction reached 83 in Q4 2021, smashing the industry average of 69.3.\nTechcombank has earmarked $500 million for tech and cloud investments over the next five years, and Lottner anticipated deployment will occur very fast.\nOthers appear to be following suit. Public investment in cloud technology is expected to grow at 16.2 percent a year through 2024, or 3.5 times higher than the expansion of the banking industry’s overall IT budget, as per IDC’s Banking on the Cloud 2021 Survey.\nAnother report on cloud computing within the financial service industry by Deloitte shows that the banks of 2030 will look very different from today, driven by changing consumer expectations, emerging technologies, and alternative business models.\nThe report said cloud-based data will be a \"game-changer\" for financial institutions to drive improved business performance and shareholder returns, through creating new business frontiers and optimizing the organization.\nSustainable growth\nTechcombank has cautiously hedged against the turmoil caused by the pandemic, to assure that operations are backed by a strong capital and liquidity foundation.\nIts operational metrics, such as capital adequacy ratio (CAR), loan to deposit ratio, and short-term funding to medium-long term loans, performed better than the requirement set by the central bank.\n\"If we zoom out to have a more holistic view, it’s not just about the numbers on the balance sheet, but it’s all about sustainability,\" Lotter opined.\n\"As long as we continue to implement our strategy, we will be able to deliver superior profitability and performance. We're doing this because we are determined to build a sustainable bank that can keep on delivering the best experience possible for our customers,\" he added.\nLast year, the Vietnamese bank trumpeted its target of a $20 billion market capitalization by 2025.\n\"We are well on track to meet this target,\" said the CEO.\nHe explained that its current trajectory would see the bank reach roughly $8 billion in equity and over $2 billion in pre-tax profit by 2025. \"If you take banks across the region, who are showing the numbers we have in terms of the growth and return on assets, they usually trade at 3-4 times book. We should be able to get to even higher numbers,\" he said.\nThat is in line with Techcombank’s ambition to become one of the 10 biggest banks in the region. \"If we want to live up to our vision of \"Change banking, change lives\" and having a positive impact on customers and on Vietnam, we need to have very strong banks. And that's what we aspire to be.\"\nStaying resilient\nWhile the Vietnamese economy is on its way to recover from global disruptions, the country is not completely immune to global supply chain impacts, from the post-pandemic aftermath to the Russia-Ukraine conflict lately.\n\"Current global events are causing some market uncertainty, but that won’t change our long-term approach. We will continue to do what we're doing well, which includes affluent banking, financing the real estate sector, and transaction banking. We will also go into future growth areas, such as everyday banking, SME-lending, and ecosystem partnerships,\" Techcombank’s CEO said.\nOn a broader view, he expected Vietnam’s gross domestic product forecast of 5-6 percent in 2022 would remain intact.\n\"In times like this, we still keep our financing lines open. And we don't have a lot of exposure to the directly impacted sectors. As a country, we're still pretty much insulated against the current scenario.\nBy the end of the quarter, Vietnam’s international borders saw a complete reopening, about three months earlier than anticipated. Economic activities domestically have resumed with almost all restrictions lifted, and we are seeing strong demand for all our products and services.\n\"We will continue mobilizing our strong balance sheet to support customer growth as they reaccelerate their operations and consumption. Vietnam’s economic recovery is well underway,\" he concluded.",

Reserves growth were down from 40.5 million ton in 2015 to 4.6 million tons.\nThe number of new fields discovered and investments also shrank.\nBetween 2011 and 2015 the number of new discoveries was 24, but it fell to seven in the next six, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\nOnly three contracts for exploration and drilling were signed between 2016 and 2020, a seventh of the number in the previous five years.\nExporter turned importer\nVietnam was a crude oil exporter, selling 5.63 million tons on the international market in 2017.\nBut it became an importer a year later, following the construction of its largest refinery, Nghi Son.\nSituated in Thanh Hoa Province, it has an annual capacity of 10 million tons of crude with a possibility to increase to 20 million.\nIt is designed to process mostly crude oil imported from Kuwait.\nLast year, two thirds of Vietnam’s crude oil output were refined at Dung Quat, the country’s first facility with a capacity of 6.5 million tons.\nThe rest was exported.\nAnalysts said Vietnam’s sweet crude (petroleum with less than 0.5% sulfur) is more expensive than the imported sour crude from the Middle East.\nIn the first four months of this year Petrovietnam saw a near doubling of its profits to VND24.1 trillion (US$1.04 billion), thanks to rising global prices.\n\"Exporting oil and then importing it for [local] production is not uncommon,\" one analyst said.\nVietnam’s fuel supply\nVietnam’s two refineries supply 10-13 million tons of petroleum products annually, accounting for 70 percent of local requirements.\nAnother 600,000 tons are produced by some condensate gas plants in the south.\nVietnam’s annual fuel demand is 20.5-21 million tons. It imports around 11.5 million tons a year, mainly from Southeast Asia, South Korea and China.\nThe country also exports around two million tons of petroleum products to markets like Cambodia (30 percent of share), Singapore (20 percent) and China (10 percent).",

        "thumbnail_url": "",
        "content": "\nTechcombank's investments in its digital platform - data analytics and talent - have laid a strong foundation to capitalize on the growing demands for its banking services, according to Jens Lottner, CEO of Techcombank.\t\nHanoi-headquartered Techcombank recorded another year of stellar financial performance and growth in 2021, while continuing to support its customers, employees and communities in Vietnam, especially those impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, the bank recorded VND37.1 trillion (over $1.6 billion) in its total operating income, up 35.4 percent year-on-year. The bank’s profit before tax (PBT) rose to VND23.2 trillion. The company has achieved double-digit PBT growth for five consecutive years, at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 50 percent between 2016 and 2021.\nThe bank’s performance remained resilient despite Covid-19 casting its shadow on the local markets and causing disruption to businesses and people’s lives. Techcombank grew its total assets by 29.4 percent, to VND568.7 trillion, and delivered an \"industry-leading\" return on its assets of 3.7 percent, according to the bank.\nIt has also been able to maintain an impressive current account and savings account (CASA) ratio, which reached 50.5 percent at the end of 2021. Its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 15 percent, while the non-performing loans ratio (NPL) stood at 0.7 percent, and the loan loss coverage ratio (LLC) was 162.9 percent.\n\"Underpinning Techcombank’s performance and enabling the resilience of its business model was on-going investments in technology, scaling up data, and developing human capital,\" Lottner explained. In an interview, Lottner spoke in details of the possible market trends impacting the Vietnamese banking industry; as well as the level of preparation Techcombank has for its digital future.\nWhy has the bank set a profit growth target of 16 percent for 2022?\nFrom 2015 to 2021, our PBT grew at a CAGR of about 50 percent. As we continue to scale our operation, the bank will reach a size where we won’t be able to maintain our current 50 percent on a yearly basis. Henceforth, we have set a target of 16 percent which we feel is highly achievable and note that this still means VND44 trillion more than last year. Is more than that possible? Yes certainly, we could achieve 40 percent growth this year if Vietnam’s economy continues to recover and the tailwinds are favorable, but not everything is in our control.\nHow about your $20 billion market cap target by 2025? \nIf you see our current trajectory, the way our earnings are increasing and the potential for growth as the Vietnamese economy recovers, I think at the end of 2025, we could easily be at about $8 billion equity value. And our pre-tax earnings could be above $2 billion if we continue on our current growth trajectory. With these numbers, the question is then on what multiple are we trading? If you look at banks across the region that are showing the types of numbers in terms of the growth and return on assets, they usually trade at three to four times book. Based on these multiples are ahead of our plan. We achieved what we wanted for 2022 already in 2021.\nWhat has the bank implemented to get there?\nOne of the priority areas in which we are investing is our transaction banking capability through our mobile app. We want to bring differentiation to the app through the application of data analysis, so for example, if you are a new-to-bank customer we can still underwrite you by quickly developing a credit score that uses up to six external data sources. The ability to interact with customers, understand them, and provide tailored financial solutions to meet their needs through our app, just as we would do in a branch, is the customer experience we want to create. Our plan is to have 5 million customers migrated completely onto the digital platform by the end of this year. We currently have around 400 people working on enhancing these digital capabilities.\nWe have set aside $500 million for tech investments over the next five years. Up to now, we have deployed around 15 percent to 20 percent of that total amount, but we expect to see an acceleration of our investment in the years ahead as we implement larger scale technology initiatives. We are committed to deploying this capital responsibly and in ways that will help transform the bank, make us more efficient and give our customers the best digital experience possible.\nOur data lake initiative involves collecting and aggregating data from different areas in the bank, and because it's so big, we have decided to put this ‘data lake’ on the cloud. We have identified the data set we want to store in the cloud, and around 70-80 percent of the data has now been transferred. We are also building an analytics infrastructure to enable us to analyze data to better understand our customers, provide a more holistic view of their needs, and enable the bank to make better and faster decisions over the types of products and services to offer. The next step will be to connect our app to the data lake infrastructure so that we make better decisions across all of our customer engagement channels.\nWhat makes Techcombank's mobile app different from those of other banks?\nWe want our mobile app platform to not just to be a service platform, but to offer the feeling of real human interaction that understands what a customer needs. That human interaction, when it comes at the scale of 15 million or 20 million customers, will only work if you connect a lot of different elements, from infrastructure, to data systems and front end systems and employ machine learning.\nWe also want to provide customers with an experience that is seamless across our different channels. There is probably only a handful of banks in the world that are anywhere close to offering this type of seamless experience for their customers and I think it will be a focus for many banks for the next 10-15 years. Look at Google, every single time more people are using it, it learns more and becomes even better. It's a virtuous cycle that is very hard to replicate.\nWhat do you make of the level of digitalization by Vietnamese banks, compared to others in the region? \nI think we are five to 10 years behind where banks in other markets are, but we are catching up fast. The main differences are in the technology stack. How scalable are the systems? How easy is it to make changes and to create new capabilities? How long does it take to get to market? A lot of the systems used by Vietnamese banks are very tightly integrated and this makes it harder to create new customer experiences, compared to what we see in other markets.\nIn terms of legal frameworks, I think that the local regulator, in certain areas, is much more open than others. For example, moving to the cloud would have been much more difficult in Singapore, Thailand or in Malaysia. People might say we are maybe too lax on data privacy, but that's not true. If you look at how much money AWS, Google and Microsoft are investing to strengthen their data protection, it's much safer to be up in the cloud than somewhere in a local data center. From that perspective, I think the regulator has the right perspective in terms of what they are intending to do.\nHowever, some of the legal frameworks probably need to be enforced. If there is a stronger sandbox regime, where people can test things in a lot of areas, it would be much more helpful. Through this sandbox regime, and through working with the banks, we could come up with solutions. If the banks can make the right case, regulators are willing to entertain us. It can be only on pilot level in the beginning, but regulators understand that they need to do something.\nThroughout your transformation process, there have been a lot of overseas hires. How will that impact your bank performance?\nThere are certain skills and capabilities we require, which are not available in the country. Everyone who's coming here has a very clear mandate to pass down his or her experiences to the staff. Ultimately, we will not be able to rely on constantly importing talent. Within Techcombank, we're not making such a big differentiation between local and foreign experts, or returning overseas Vietnamese. A lot of our current employees are starting to build their careers with the bank. On the other hand, as we start transforming, our aspiration is to become one of the leading banks in ASEAN. So for a lot of experts, this becomes a very different proposition for them. They are excited by the growth, and the quality of work and the people they're working with.",

        "content": "\nVietnam should stay away from investments that don't make it competitive and experiment with real estate taxes to sustainably develop its economy, Harvard University experts have advised.\t\nAt a Saturday conference in Harvard University on Vietnam's development strategy in the 21st century, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said Vietnam's economy has expanded into the fourth largest economy in ASEAN and among the world's top 12 economies with the largest scale of commerce. The country also takes part in 15 active FTAs, he said.\nEconomist David Dapic said Vietnam taking part in FTAs was a major success. Millions of farmers have moved on to work in factories as a result. But the fact that most materials for production are imported from China is a weakness, he added.\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, borders were closed and there was commercial tension, Vietnam's exports were affected, Dapic said.\nVietnam's trade turnover with the U.S. may reach $100 billion this year. Such a figure might be small for the U.S., but Vietnam should take note to remain in constant communication and avoid being accused of currency manipulation, he advised.\nNguyen Thi Hong, head of the State Bank of Vietnam, said economic integration may bring many opportunities, but there were many challenges as well. Banks should increase their forecast and analytic capabilities to ensure consistent, appropriate policies, and not use currency as a competitive advantage in commerce.\n\"Vietnam's control of inflation is very impressive, going hand in hand with a fairly high growth speed. The foreign currency market is stable, and is an opportunity for Vietnam to raise its credit ranking,\" Hong said.\nRegarding the digital economy, Dapic said FDI, international commerce and education and training cooperation were essential. Attracting FDI was getting more difficult, and for Vietnam's economy to be trustworthy and reputable, it needs to avoid investment sources that don't make it competitive, he said.\nThe economy must also be open, especially in information exchange do as to attract more talents and make investors more comfortable with the business environment, he added.\nOne characteristic of Vietnam is the fact that many localities are located far away and don't have accessible infrastructure to attract FDI. Vietnam should experiment with real estate taxation and allow localities to impose such taxes and use the money gained for investment instead of relying on the national budget, Dapic said.\nNguyen Chi Dung, Minister of Planning and Investment, said sustainable development required more than a sustainable economy. It needs a sustainable culture, society and people. Vietnam therefore puts human beings at the center of its policymaking.\n\"Vietnam sees that quick and sustainable development must rely on new driving forces. Besides institutions and infrastructure, there also needs to be the drivers of science and technology, innovation and cultural values,\" Dung said.\nPM Chinh is in the U.S. to attend the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, pay an official visit to the country and work with the United Nations. on May 12 and 13. The week long visit is expected to end May 17.",

Being independent and self-reliant however doesn't mean shutting off from the world; it must go hand in hand with policies for international integration, he added.\nAn independent and self-reliant economy is also tied to being politically independent. Respecting the differences between different political, economic, historical, cultural and social features would create diversity for the world economy, Chinh said. He also mentioned about respecting nations' rights and rightful interests in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.\nBuilding such an economy has always been Vietnam's stance since 1945, and it has withstood multiple shocks, for example the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nVietnam needs to continue to build its economy with the same trajectory to solve multiple challenges, ensure national independence, sovereignty and interests, increase its innate power to integrate into the world economy, and uphold international commitments.\nVietnam's strategic development goal by 2030 is to become a developing country with modern industry and high income. By 2045, it aims to become a developed country with high income. To achieve that, there needs to be an economy with appropriate, sustainable and effective proportions, as well as being competitive and adaptive.\nLocalities also need to make use of opportunities given by international integration to recover and sustainably develop. Progress, social fairness and social security remain to be of utmost importance, Chinh said.\nThe three pillars of such an economy is a socialist-oriented market economy, a socialist state with rule of law, and a socialist democracy. Human beings would be the drive for development, he added.\n\"There is a need to build and utilize Vietnam's cultural values and the power of the Vietnamese people to truly possess an innate power and a drive to protect and develop the country,\" he said.\nFor there to be an independent, self-reliant economy, Vietnam needs to maintain its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as socio-political stability. It also needs to complete the institution for a socialist-oriented market economy that's modern and compatible with international commitments; maintain the stability of the macroeconomy; and reorient the economy towards a development model that mainly depends on science and technology, innovation, resource efficiency and green growth.\nVietnam also needs to make use of every resources and utilizes the role of businesses both inside and outside of Vietnam while developing its workforce.\nChinh is in the U.S. for the U.S.-ASEAN Summit on May 12 and 13. He will also work with the U.S. and the U.N. afterwards, where his visit is expected to last until May 17.",
